# TechMe School

Welcome to **[TechMe School]**, an independent and innovative coding pedagogy inspired by project-based learning models like ALX, 1337, and Holberton School.

## 📚 About Us

**[TechMe School]** is a self-driven, peer-to-peer learning environment where students master software engineering through hands-on projects, real-world challenges, and collaboration — without traditional lectures or teachers.

We believe in:

- 📁 **Project-based learning**
- 🤝 **Peer-to-peer correction**
- 🚀 **Autonomy and initiative**
- 🧠 **Problem-solving over memorization**

## 💡 Pedagogical Principles

- **No teachers** – We learn through documentation, teamwork, and experimentation.
- **Real-world projects** – Modeled after industry practices, from low-level C to high-level full stack.
- **Continuous peer review** – Learn by explaining, reviewing, and improving together.
- **Strict deadlines** – We build discipline, not just code.
